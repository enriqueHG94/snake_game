# **snake_game**
This is a Python project that uses the Turtle module to create a classic snake game. The objective of the game is to control a snake that moves around the screen and eats the food that appears in random positions. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows by one more segment and the score increases. The game ends if the snake bumps into the edges of the screen or its own body.
## **Features**
- The game has a simple and colourful graphical interface, with a white snake, a blue food and a white scoreboard.
- The game is controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard, which change the direction of the snake's head.
- The game has a constant speed, which can be adjusted by changing the value of the MOVE_DISTANCE variable in the snake.py file.
- The game displays the message "GAME OVER" when it ends, and can be closed by clicking on the screen.
## **Installation**
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.
You also need to have the Turtle module installed, which is included in the standard Python installation. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:

pip install turtle
## **Usage**
To start the game, clone this repository or download the files snake.py, food.py, scoreboard.py and main.py in the same folder. Then, open a terminal in that folder and run the following command:

python main.py

This will open a window with the game. Use the arrow keys to move the snake and eat the food. Enjoy the game and try to get the highest score possible.
